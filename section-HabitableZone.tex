The intent is for this to cover any HZ objects that are new, or changed from DR24. See Figure~\ref{f:catalogPlot}.

    \caption{DR25 Exoplanet Candidates plotted as planet radius against Insolation Flux, in units of the flux that the Earth recieves from the Sun. The stellar temperature is given by the color of the circle and the size of the circle indicates the Disposition Score. The planet radii are derived from the MCMC fits. }
