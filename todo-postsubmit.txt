From Nick Law. Improve section on follow-up observations to include some of the non-funded, non-KFOP observations.

I do have a request/correction: in the introduction, you mention "the Kepler mission benefited from an active, funded, follow-up observing program”, and say "The followup program obtained high-resolution imaging of ≈90% of known KOIs”, and then cite only Furlan et al. 2017. This isn’t quite correct — in fact, more than 2,000 of the KOIs have *only* been observed by our Robo-AO follow-up program, which was separately funded by NASA under the XRP program (no Kepler/KFOP funding was offered). This is confirmed in Furlan et al. (e.g. "of the 3665 stars that host at least one KOI planet candidate or confirmed planet, Robo-AO observed 3093”).

Our grad students would be very grateful if you’d be willing to cite the Robo-AO papers that describe this work (listed below). If you’d like to also list the various other teams that also performed follow-up work separately from KFOP but were compiled by Furlan et al., we’d be happy to provide bibtex cites for them (Adam Kraus’s Keck aperture-masking program, for example, has covered more than 500 of the KOIs).

The Robo-AO papers are:

Sec 7.5.1, par. 1: "reliablilty" => reliability
 
Sec 7.5.1, par. 1, end: "Kepler was not designed to reach the
habitable zones of F-type stars, nor did the target list include many
such stars."  The first half is OK, but the 2nd half seems odd.
The Mathur et al. 2017 stellar catalog contains 197k stars, and
approximately 65k of these have Teff between ~6000K and ~7200K, that
are likely to be F-stars (i.e. about a third are F stars!).
Or by "F-type stars", do you mean "F-type dwarf stars" in particular?
 
Sec 7.5.1, equation 9: very minor nit - there is now a nominal solar
effective temperature from IAU Resolution 2015 B2: Teff = 5772K (see
Prsa et al 2016; see justification and discussion in
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AJ....152...41P,
https://www.iau.org/administration/resolutions/general_assemblies/IAU2015_English.pdf).
Minor, but one of the motivations was for Kepler eclipsing binaries(!)
when system parameters were being so well defined that the assumed
solar parameters mattered at several significant figures (although not
the case here where uncertainties are typically of order ~10% or more).
 
Sec 8.2, par. 1: italicize "vespa"?

Rubble in section A.3.7.1 Change the threshold from 0.5 to 0.75
