Each KOI, whether from a previous catalog or new to the DR25 catalog, were fit with a transit model in a consistent manner. The model fitting was performed in a similar manner as described in \S5 of \citet{Rowe2015cat}. The basic steps to do the model fits start with the DR25 Q1-Q17 PDC photometry from MAST\footnote{https://archive/stsci.edu.kepler/}. The photometry was detrended using a polynomial filter as described in \S4 of \citet{Rowe2014}. A transit model based on \citet{Mandel2002} was utilized in the fitting, assuming circular orbits and using quadratic limb darkening \citep{Claret2011} calculated for updated stellar parameters \citep{Mathur2017}. The transit model fits were obtained with least-squares minimization using a Levenberg-Marquardt routine \citep{More1980}. The uncertainties for the fitted parameters are calculated using a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method \citep{Ford2005AJ} with 2$\times 10^{5}$ chains calculated for each fit. In order to calculate the posterior distribution the first 20\% of each chain was discarded. The transit model fit parameters were combined with the stellar parameters and error bars \citep{Mathur2017} in order to produce the reported planetary fits. The MCMC chains themselves are all available and documented in \citet{Hoffman2017}. 

The planet parameters are from the least-squares model fits and the errors from the MCMC calculations. These values are listed at the NASA Exoplanet Archive. Note that not all KOIs could be successfully modelled, resulting in three different fit types: ``LS+MCMC", ``LS", and ``none". In the case of ``LS+MCMC" the KOIs were fully modelled with both a model fit and MCMC calculations were completed. In the cases where the MCMC calculations did not converge but there are is a model fit, the least-square parameters are available without uncertainties. In the final case, where a KOI could not be modelled, as in cases where the transit event was not recovered in the detrending used for the MCMC fits; only the period, epoch and duration of the federated TCE are reported and the fit type is listed as "none".
