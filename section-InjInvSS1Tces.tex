 At our disposal we have two additional data sets with which to test our metrics, a population of signals we know to be real (Injection) and a population of signals we know to be false (inversion). We use these to gain a sense of the quality of our catalog.

\subsection{Injection}
\label{injectsec}

A Quick summary of how injection was done and what we produce with injection. Show a plot of the distribution of recovered injected things in terms of period and MES.

\subsection{Inversion} 
A summary of how inversion was done and what we get from it. Discuss where its limitations as a population of false positives, which ones do we know we are missing. If we have a way of ameliorating this issue, like with season scrambling, discuss that too.

\subsection{Previous Catalogs}In addition we have confirmed planets and confirmed false positives. However, these are not great tests for low MES or long Period.
