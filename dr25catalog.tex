\title{Planetary Candidates Observed by \Kepler. VIII.\\
A Fully Automated Catalog With Measured Completeness and Reliability\\Based on Data Release 25 }

%\author{Susan E. Thompson and others}
\input{authors}

\begin{abstract}
We discuss the Kepler Object of Interest (KOI) catalog based on searching data release 25, Q1--Q17, \Kepler{} time series photometry for transiting exoplanets.  This catalog of 4034 candidates builds on the knowledge and tools of previous KOI catalogs, is uniformly vetted, and provides a measurement of the catalog's completeness and reliability against instrumental and stellar noise. With this information, the catalog can be used to calculate planetary occurrence rates even for the terrestrial-sized planets in orbital periods of hundreds of days, right at the detection limit for \Kepler{} data.  This paper discusses the vetting methods used by a tool called the Robovetter to determine which of the \ntces{} signals found by the \Kepler{} Pipeline are truly transiting exoplanets.  The Robovetter was also used to vet simulated transits signals and simulated noise signals in order to test its performance and to characterize the properties of the final catalog. In addition to the disposition, each of the 8054 KOIs in the catalog is provided with a Markov chain Monte Carlo fit that provides a robust set of planetary parameters with error bars based on the posteriors. This final search of the four years of \Kepler{} data yielded 219 new planet candidates, 10 of which are high reliability, super-Earth-sized planets in the wide habitable zone of their star. For periods less than 100\,d the Robovetter found more than 85 per cent of the injected transits and $>$98 per cent of the catalog's candidates are true astrophysical events.   However, for low signal-to-noise candidates found between 200 and 500 \,d the catalog is only 73 per cent complete and 37 per cent reliable. We describe how the completeness and reliability of the catalog varies with period, signal-to-noise, and stellar type. We also provide several ways to select a more reliable, albeit less complete, sample of candidates, using a metric called the disposition. All of the signals found in the \Kepler{} data used to create and characterize this catalog are available at the NASA Exoplanet Archive.

%\subsection{Individual Metrics, updates and improvements}

%\paragraph{Not-Transit-Like Metrics} 
%Some metrics that determine if a TCE is not-transit-like operate on the individual transits. We define not-transit-like as anything that does not have three periodic, box- or v-shaped events. Primarily we try to eliminate TCEs caused by instrumental or data-reduction-pipeline effects (like Sudden Pixel Sensitivity Drop Outs or detrending artifacts) and smoothly varying variable stars (pulsators, contact binaries and ellipsoidal binaries) with this high level flag.   These individual metrics are as follows: Marshall, Skye, Chases, and Rubble. The Robovetter also recalculates the MES based on the good transits and counts the number of good transits to decide which TCEs should be considered False Positives. 

%\input{individualMetrics.tex}


%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Marshall
%\input{marshall.tex}
%\item Skye
%\item ChASES
%\item Rubble
%\item Rocky
%\item Grouping single transit failures and recalculating MES and counting the number of transits.
%\end{enumerate}

%Other metrics operate on data gathered using all the photometric data to determine if the transit signal is transit-like.  These metrics are as follows:

%\begin{enumerate}
%\item LPP retrained
%\item Model Shift Uniqueness
%\item SWEET -- for N flag
%\item Grouped ChASES
%\item Model Shift DMM
%\item Model Shift Shape Metric
%\item MES/SES

%\end{enumerate}

%\paragraph{Significant Secondary Metrics}
%Some metrics look for evidence that a transit-like signal is actually due to %an eclipsing binary (foreground or background).  It primarily looks for %evidence of a secondary eclipse, but there are also metrics to look for %ellipsoidal

%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Model Shift Secondary
%\item Model Shift Odd-Even
%\item Simple Odd-Even
%\item SWEET -- for S flag (we might need to combine N and S for this reason)
%\end{enumerate}


%\paragraph{Centroid Offset} We vet the catalog for evidence that the the target is a false positive because of a background eclipsing binary. The Centroid Robovetter us run on the pixel level data to determine if this is the case.  This is unchanged from the previous two catalogs.  The \textbf{Ghostbuster metric} is also used to determine if the TCE signal is from pixels other than the star.

%\paragraph{Ephemeris Matching} We also look for evidence that
