\begin{abstract}
Enlightening words about the purpose of this final Kepler Catalog and how it fits in with the other Kepler Planet Candidate catalogs. Then some details about how many KOIs we added and how many are planet candidates. 
\end{abstract}


\section{Scope}
Overall, the purpose of this paper is to describe how we sifted through the DR25 TCE table and identified the planet candidates, the transiting candidates with significant secondaries, background eclipsing binaries, ephemeris matches and the false alarms. It also needs to describe how we arrive at the reported physical parameters of each planet, so that interesting populations for occurrence rates and follow-up can be identified.  Finally the Completeness and Reliablity of the catalog should be discussed.

Here is a basic outline.
\begin{itemize}
\item Introduction  (Kepler is great blah, blah, KOI catalog blah blah, Cool Discoveries..)

\item A description of the Q1-Q17 DR25 TCEs

\item A description of Injection and Inversion as True Candidates and False Positives.

\item A description of the Robovetter. Summarize the Robovetter, but lean heavily on Coughlin (2016). Discuss why we needed to improve the Robovetter.  Each metric that changed from DR24 Robovetter should be discussed. A list of all minor RoboVetter flags needs to be created and how they relate to the major flags. A discussion of the Robovetter Scores and how they were calculated.

\item A discussion of how the Robovetter metrics were tuned, how were thresholds set? 

\item Evaluate the Completeness of the catalog based on transit injection in MES vs. Period. Also discuss the Confirmed planets and the number that are missed. Give a sense as to where the robovetter is missing planets.

\item Discuss the Effectiveness. Discuss the importance of reliability and how we can use Inversion to get an estimate (a bound?) of the reliability across MES and Period. Also discuss the False Positive table and the number of incorrect dispositions.  Give a sense as to where/when robovetter is ineffective and/or unreliable.

\item Creating the Catalog: Federating to old KOIs, Transit model fits and comparision to DV, how the robovetter was run (inputs/outputs, a summary),  Catalog deliverables. 

\item Analysis of the content of the catalog: Show Candidates on the radius vs. insolation flux labeled by stellar temperature (Coughlin Fig 7.), discuss Multi-planet systems, discuss new individual Rocky-HZ Planet Candidates, enumerate the number of new KOIs of different sizes.

\item Discussion of how to use this catalog to do occurrence rates. i.e. what needs to be considered (Completeness and Reliability, suspicious areas of parameter space, are additional cuts required?), not an actual calculation. Indicate what information will be delivered to NExScI to help with these calculations. 

\item Conclusion 


\end{itemize}

\section{Introduction}

In 2004 the \Kepler\ space telescope was launched into an earth trailing orbit with the goal of finding evidence of transiting exoplanets \citep{Koch2010}. This was done by monitoring the brightness of over 150,000 stars for four years looking for a small decrease in the brightness of the star caused by a planet passing between the star and the \Kepler\ spacecraft.  Since \Kepler's launch in 2009 it has succeeded in identifying X,XXX planet candidates \citep{Borucki2010,Coughlin20016} and X,XXX confirmed \citep[e.g.][]{FOP?} or validated planets \citep[see most recently][]{Morton2016}. 

Because of the \Kepler\ data, the landscape of known exoplanets has expanded, finding smaller planets in more distant orbits from their host stars.  To highlight a few examples,  \Kepler\ found terrestrial planets as small as Kepler-37b \citep{Barclay2013}, a moon sized planet in a 13.3 day period. \Kepler\ has even found small exoplanets in the habitable zone of their host star, e.g. Kepler-186f \citep{Quintana2014} and Kepler-452b \citep{Jenkins2015}.  The Kepler data has also shown how exoplanets are commonly found in exoplanetary systems. These systems can be compact like the system around Kepler-11, where there are six planets all with periods less than XX days. Also, because of the long continuous data set, exoplanets have been found orbiting binary stars, e.g. Kepler-16\citep{Doyle2011}.


The impact of \Kepler\ on our understanding of exoplanets comes not only from these individual systems, but from the plethora of planets of every type that it has found. Understanding how common different types of exoplanets are around different types of stars will be one of its lasting legacy. \Kepler\ has shown us that most stars have exoplanets and that super-Earth and small planets are more common than their larger cousins \citet{Burke2015}.  


And for each of these unique systems, there are a plethora of exoplanets This plethora of planets \Kepler\ has shown that small planets are common

\section{The Q1--Q17 DR25 TCEs}
\input{dr25TCEs.tex}


\section{Tools for Evaluating Performance}
 At our disposal we have two additional data sets with which to test our metrics, a population of signals we know to be real (Injection) and a population of signals we know to be false (inversion). We use these to gain a sense of the quality of our catalog.
\subsection{Injection} 
A Quick summary of how injection was done and what we produce with injection. Show a plot of the distribution of recovered injected things in terms of period and MES.
\subsection{Inversion} 
A summary of how inversion was done and what we get from it. Discuss where its limitations as a population of false positives, which ones do we know we are missing. If we have a way of ameliorating this issue, like with season scrambling, discuss that too.

\subsection{Previous Catalogs}In addition we have confirmed planets and confirmed false positives. However, these are not great tests for low MES or long Period.


\section{Vetting Methods and Metrics}

\subsection{Robovetter Overview}
Describe here the idea of not-transit-like and how we look for evidence that the signal is due to an eclipsing binary. Include an updated Figure 2 from the previous paper. Introduce the major flags.
\subsubsection{Using the DR24 Robovetter}
 We applied the DR24 robovetter to the DR25 TCEs. 
 We found that we needed to do better in the following areas.
 Don't forget to cite \citet{Tange2011a}.
 \input{applydr24rv.tex}

\caption{\red{An Overview of the Robovetter logic. This is from DR24, so needs to be updated}}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Individual Metrics, updates and improvements}

\paragraph{Not-Transit-Like Metrics} 
Some metrics that determine if a TCE is not-transit-like operate on the individual transits. We define not-transit-like as anything that does not have three periodic, box- or v-shaped events. Primarily we try to eliminate TCEs caused by instrumental or data-reduction-pipeline effects (like Sudden Pixel Sensitivity Drop Outs or detrending artifacts) and smoothly varying variable stars (pulsators, contact binaries and ellipsoidal binaries) with this high level flag.   These individual metrics are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Marshall
\input{marshall.tex}
\item Skye
\item ChASES
\item Rubble
\item Rocky
\item Grouping single transit failures and recalculating MES and counting the number of transits.
\end{enumerate}

Other metrics operate on data gathered using all the photometric data to determine if the transit signal is transit-like.  These metrics are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item LPP retrained
\item Model Shift Uniqueness
\item SWEET -- for N flag
\item Grouped ChASES
\item Model Shift DMM
\item Model Shift Shape Metric
\item MES/SES

\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Significant Secondary Metrics}
Some metrics look for evidence that a transit-like signal is actually due to an eclipsing binary (foreground or background).  It primarily looks for evidence of a secondary eclipse, but there are also metrics to look for ellipsoidal

\begin{enumerate}
\item Model Shift Secondary
\item Model Shift Odd-Even
\item Simple Odd-Even
\item SWEET -- for S flag (we might need to combine N and S for this reason)
\end{enumerate}


\paragraph{Centroid Offset} We vet the catalog for evidence that the the target is a false positive because of a background eclipsing binary. The Centroid Robovetter us run on the pixel level data to determine if this is the case.  This is unchanged from the previous two catalogs.  The \textbf{Ghostbuster metric} is also used to determine if the TCE signal is from pixels other than the star.

\paragraph{Ephemeris Matching} We also look for evidence that
