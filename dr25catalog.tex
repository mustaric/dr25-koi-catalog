\title{Planetary Candidates Observed by \Kepler. VIII.\\
A Fully Automated Catalog Based on Data Release 25\\Tuned For High Completeness and Reliability. }

%\author{Susan E. Thompson and others}
\input{authors}

\begin{abstract}
Enlightening words about the purpose of this final Kepler Catalog and how it fits in with the other Kepler Planet Candidate catalogs. Then some details about how many KOIs we added and how many are planet candidates. 
Overall, the purpose of this paper is to describe how we sifted through the DR25 TCE table and identified the planet candidates, the transiting candidates with significant secondaries, background eclipsing binaries, ephemeris matches and the false alarms. It also needs to describe how we arrive at the reported physical parameters of each planet, so that interesting populations for occurrence rates and follow-up can be identified.  Finally the completeness and reliability of the catalog should be discussed.

To Do List:
\begin{itemize}
\item History of Kepler and Exoplanets, context
\item Table of our results
\item Table of INV/SCR cleaned KICs
\item Discussion of where Robovetter needs improvements -- specific known failures. State that some confirmed planets failed.
\item tuning the catalog [JEFF]
\item Table of parameters for Steve's optimization.
\item INJ-TCEs in more detail [JESSIE]
\item CHASES description [Chris]
\item are there new Multi-Planet Systems to discuss
\item Discussion of the HZ Zone objects...are there new ones?
\item How this information will inform occurrence rates (basically)
\item description of how the number of planets does not change with score cut vs just using dispositions for occurrence rates.
\item The Catalog using the derived fitted information, completeness, reliability especially.
\item what is new in this catalog. What fraction of previous KOIs recovered.

\end{itemize}




{\color{red}

Items we may want to discuss in the paper but for now I have decided to leave out.
\begin{itemize}
\item exact reasons each confirmed planet failed the robovetter. [see the tables]
\item A comparison  of EBs between us and the EB catalog
\item Analysis of the injected EBs (secondaries) in terms of effectiveness.
\item Measurement of effectiveness or completeness based on hand vetting.
\item A list of what was missed that are in other Kepler catalogs (Planet Hunters Catalog, Ojeda short period ones, previous KOI Tables, Confirmed planets.)
\end{itemize}

Items that do not belong in this paper:
\begin{itemize}
\item An estimate of eta Earth or the occurrence rate for any type of planet.
\item Discussion of metrics not used by the Robovetter.
\end{itemize}

%\subsection{Individual Metrics, updates and improvements}

%\paragraph{Not-Transit-Like Metrics} 
%Some metrics that determine if a TCE is not-transit-like operate on the individual transits. We define not-transit-like as anything that does not have three periodic, box- or v-shaped events. Primarily we try to eliminate TCEs caused by instrumental or data-reduction-pipeline effects (like Sudden Pixel Sensitivity Drop Outs or detrending artifacts) and smoothly varying variable stars (pulsators, contact binaries and ellipsoidal binaries) with this high level flag.   These individual metrics are as follows: Marshall, Skye, Chases, and Rubble. The Robovetter also recalculates the MES based on the good transits and counts the number of good transits to decide which TCEs should be considered False Positives.

%\item Marshall
%\input{marshall.tex}
%\item Skye
%\item ChASES
%\item Rubble
%\item Rocky
%\item Grouping single transit failures and recalculating MES and counting the number of transits.
%\end{enumerate}

%Other metrics operate on data gathered using all the photometric data to determine if the transit signal is transit-like.  These metrics are as follows:

%\begin{enumerate}
%\item LPP retrained
%\item Model Shift Uniqueness
%\item SWEET -- for N flag
%\item Grouped ChASES
%\item Model Shift DMM
%\item Model Shift Shape Metric
%\item MES/SES

%\end{enumerate}

%\paragraph{Significant Secondary Metrics}
%Some metrics look for evidence that a transit-like signal is actually due to %an eclipsing binary (foreground or background).  It primarily looks for %evidence of a secondary eclipse, but there are also metrics to look for %ellipsoidal

%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Model Shift Secondary
%\item Model Shift Odd-Even
%\item Simple Odd-Even
%\item SWEET -- for S flag (we might need to combine N and S for this reason)
%\end{enumerate}


%\paragraph{Centroid Offset} We vet the catalog for evidence that the the target is a false positive because of a background eclipsing binary. The Centroid Robovetter us run on the pixel level data to determine if this is the case.  This is unchanged from the previous two catalogs.  The \textbf{Ghostbuster metric} is also used to determine if the TCE signal is from pixels other than the star.

%\paragraph{Ephemeris Matching} We also look for evidence that
