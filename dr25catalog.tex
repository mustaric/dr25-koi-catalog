\title{Planetary Candidates Observed by \Kepler. VIII.\\
A Fully Automated Catalog With Measured Completeness and Reliability\\Based on Data Release 25 }

%\author{Susan E. Thompson and others}
\input{authors}

\begin{abstract}
We present the Kepler Object of Interest (KOI) catalog based on searching four years of \Kepler{} time series photometry (Data Release 25, Q1--Q17) for transiting exoplanets. This catalog contains 4034 candidates with periods between 0.25 and 632 days and is created using entirely automated methods. Additionally, using simulated transits and simulated noise, we measure the vetting completeness and catalog reliability in order for the catalog to be used to calculate more accurate planetary occurrence rates --- even for the terrestrial-sized planets with orbital periods of hundreds of days, which is right at the detection limit for \Kepler{} data. At low signal-to-noise, instrumental and stellar noise are easily mistaken for astrophysical transits. By quantifying the reliability of declared candidates, this catalog can be used to accurately count the frequency of temperate, super-Earth planets around Sun-like stars in our Galaxy.


This paper discusses the vetting methods used by a tool called the Robovetter to determine which of the \ntces{} Threshold Crossing Events (TCEs) found by the \Kepler{} Pipeline \citep{Twicken2016} are most likely caused by exoplanet transits.  The Robovetter was also used to vet simulated transits, simulated systematic noise, and simulated astrophysical false positives in order to measure its performance and to characterize the properties of the final catalog. In addition, each of the 8054 KOIs in the catalog is provided with a fit that provides a robust set of planetary parameters and Markov chain Monte Carlo error bars. This final search of the four years of \Kepler{} data yielded 219 new planet candidates, 10 of which are highly reliable, super-Earth-sized planets in a wide habitable zone of their star. For orbital periods less than 100\,d the Robovetter completeness across all observed stars, or the fraction of injections that are determined to be planet candidates, is greater than 85\%. For the same period range the catalog reliability, or the fraction of candidates that are not due to instrumental or stellar noise, is greater than 98\%.  However, for low signal-to-noise candidates found between 200 and 500 days our measurements indicate that the Robovetter is 73\% complete and 37\% reliable. We describe how the measured completeness and reliability varies with period, signal-to-noise, number of transits, and stellar type. We also discuss a value called the disposition score which provides an easy way to select a more reliable, albeit less complete, sample of candidates. The entire KOI catalog and all of the simulated data used to characterize this catalog are available at the NASA Exoplanet Archive.
