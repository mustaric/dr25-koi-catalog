The DR25 KOI catalog of exoplanet candidates has been carefully characterized so that it can be the input to occurrence rate studies of exoplanets in periods as long as 500 days. The detection efficiency of the entire search \citep{Burke2017b,Christiansen2017} and of the Robovetter vetting process has been calculated by injecting planetary transits into the data and determining which types of planets are found and which are missed. For this DR25 KOI catalog, the vetting completeness has been balanced against how often false alarms are mistaken for candidates, i.e. the catalog reliability. This is the first \Kepler{} exoplanet catalog to be characterized in this way, enabling occurrence rate measurements at the detection limit of the mission.  As a result accurate measurements of the frequency of terrestrial-sized planets in orbital periods of hundreds of days is possible.

The measurement of the reliability using the inverted and scrambled light curves is new to this KOI catalog. We measure how often noise is labeled as a planet candidate and combine that information with the number of false alarms coming from the \Kepler{} Pipeline. Some pure noise signals so closely mimic transiting signals that it is nearly impossible to remove them all. Because of this, it is absolutely imperative that those using this candidate catalog for occurrence rates consider this source of noise. For periods longer than $\sim$200 days and radii less than $\sim$4\Rearth, these noise events are often labelled as PC and thus the reliability of the catalog is near 50\%.  Astrophysical reliability is another concern that must be accounted for independently.  However, even once it is shown that another astrophysical scenario is unlikely \citep[as was done for the DR24 KOIs in ][]{Morton2017}, the PCs in this catalog cannot be validated without first showing that the candidates have a sufficiently high false alarm reliability. 

We have shown several ways to identify a subset of the catalog that has higher reliability, though a worse completeness. Reliability is a strong function of the MES and the number of observed transits. Also, the FGK dwarf stars are known to be quieter than giant stars and in general the true transits can be more easily separated from the false alarms. We also provide the disposition score, a measure of how robustly a candidate has passed the Robovetter; this can be used to easily find the most reliable candidates. Those doing follow-up observations of KOIs may also use this disposition score to identify the candidates that will optimize ground-based follow-up observations.

Some of the most scrutinized signals in the DR25 KOI catalog will likely be those forty-nine small, temperate PCs in the eta-Earth sample defined in \S\ref{s:hz}.  These signals, with their well characterized completeness and reliability, can be used to make the most direct measurement on the occurrence rate of planets with the size and insolation flux as Earth, especially around GK dwarf stars.  While this catalog is an important step forward in measuring this number, it is important to remember a few potential biases inherent to this catalog when using this catalog of planetary candidates. Namely, the stellar parameter errors create significant errors on the planetary sizes and orbital distances and unaccounted for background stars make planet radii appear smaller than reality and also impact the detection limit of the search for all stars.  Also, the Robovetter was not perfect, completeness of the vetting procedures and the reliability of these signals (astrophysical and false alarm) must be considered in any calculation.

Ultimately, characterizing this catalog was made possible because of the Robovetter and the innovative metrics (\S\ref{s:robovetter}) it uses to vet each TCE. It has improved the uniformity and accuracy of the vetting process and has allowed the entire process to be tested with known transits and known false positives. As a result the Robovetter could be run many times, each time improving the vetting by changing thresholds or introducing new metrics. We adapted our vetting process as we learned more about the data set, ensuring the highest reliability and completeness achievable in the time allowed.  The Robovetter metrics and logic may prove useful for future transit missions that will find an unprecedented abundance of signals that will require rapid identification of the candidates for ground-based follow-up, e.g. K2 \citep{Howell2014}, TESS \citep{Ricker2015}, and PLATO \citep{Rauer2016}.
