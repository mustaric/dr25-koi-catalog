\subsection{Terms and Acronyms}
\label{abbrev}
We try to avoid unnecessary acronyms and abbreviations, but a few are required to efficiently discuss this catalog.  Here we itemize those terms and abbreviations that are specific to this paper and are used repeatedly. The list is short enough that we choose to group them by meaning instead of alphabetically. 

\begin{itemize}

\item[] \textbf{TCE}: Threshold Crossing Event. Periodic signals identified by the transiting planet search (TPS) module of the \Kepler{} Pipeline \citep{JenkinsKDPH}.
\item[] \textbf{\opstce}: Observed TCEs. TCEs found by searching the observed DR25 \Kepler\ data and reported in \citet{Twicken2016}.
\item[] \textbf{\injtce}: Injected TCEs. TCEs found that match a known, injected transit signal \citep{Christiansen2017}.
\item[] \textbf{\invtce}: Inverted TCEs. TCEs found when searching the inverted data set in order to simulate instrumental false alarms \citep{Coughlin2017a}.
\item[] \textbf{\scrtce}: Scrambled TCEs. TCEs found when searching the scrambled data set in order to simulate instrumental false alarms \citep{Coughlin2017a}.
\item[] \textbf{TPS}: Transiting Planet Search module. This module of the Kepler pipeline performs the search for planet candidates. This module identifies TCEs.
\item[] \textbf{DV}: Data Validation. Named after the module of the \Kepler\ Pipeline which characterizes the transits and outputs the \Kepler\ Pipeline's light curve detrending. DV is also used to refer to two sets of transit fits: original and supplemental \citep{JenkinsKDPH}.
\item[] \textbf{ALT}: Alternative. An alternative detrending, based on the methods of \citet{Garcia2010}, is utilized by several Robovetter metrics. The \Kepler{} Pipeline performs a trapezoidal fit to the folded transit on the ALT detrended light curves.
\item[] \textbf{MES}: Multiple Event Statistic. A statistic that measures the combined significance of all of the observed transits in the detrended, whitened light curve assuming a linear ephemeris \citep[][]{Jenkins2002b}.
\item[] \textbf{SPSD}: Sudden Pixel Sensitivity Dropout.  A pixel can suddenly lose sensitivity after a cosmic ray hit and gradually regain sensitivity over a few hours.
\item[] \textbf{KOI}: Kepler Object of Interest. Periodic, transit-like events that are significant enough to warrant further review. A KOI is identified with a KOI number and can be dispositioned as a planet candidate or a false positive.d  The DR25 KOIs are a subset of the DR25 \opstce{s}.
\item[] \textbf{PC}: Planet Candidate. A TCE or KOI that passes all of the Robovetter tests and metrics. 
\item[] \textbf{FP}: False Positive. A TCE or KOI that fails one or more of the Robovetter tests and metrics. Notice that the term includes all types of signals found in the TCE lists that are not caused by a transiting exoplanet, including eclipsing binaries and instrumental false alarms.
\item[] \textbf{MCMC}: Markov chain Monte Carlo. This refers to transit fits which employ a MCMC algorithm in order to provide errors for fitted model parameters for all KOIs
 \citep{Hoffman2017}.
