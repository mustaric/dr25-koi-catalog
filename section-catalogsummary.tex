\subsection{Summary of the Exoplanet Catalog}
The DR25 exoplanet candidate catalog has the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item [o] plot of pradius vs. period and/or pradius vs insol. flux
    \item [o] Histogram of number of candidates of different sizes (short and long period)
    \item [o] Discuss number of candidates compared to previous catalogs.
    \item [o] Discuss identified EBs.
    \item [o] From looking at distributions obvious over abundance at 370 days.
\end{itemize}
