\subsection{DR25 KOI Catalog Completeness and Reliability}
The Robovetter is mostly agnostic to the transit fit and stellar parameters and so measuring the completeness and reliability of the resulting catalog is best understood in terms of parameters that are similarly blind to that process.  Here we discuss the performance of the robovetter and the measured completeness and reliability of the catalog in terms of raw parameters such as MES and period, as well as derived parameters such as planet radius and insolation flux.

Figure 6 from Coughlin needs to be redone here.
