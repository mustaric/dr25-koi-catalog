%Words about applying the DR24 robovetter to the DR25 TCEs.
Our first attempt at vetting the DR25 TCE list was done by applying the DR24 Robovetter \citep{Coughlin2016}. To do this, we calculated the metrics described in \citet{Coughlin2016}, such as the LPP Metric, the Marshall Metric, the Model-Shift Uniqueness Test, the Significant Secondary Test, the Centroid Offset and the Ephemeris matching.  We were then able to evaluate the performance of this version of the 
robovetter using the pixel-level transit injection and inversion data. 


Clearly, these results indicate that the TCE population had changed enough to require improvements to the robovetter in order to achieve a highly complete and highly reliability catalog.
