%Section Balancing Completeness and Reliability
\label{s:optimize}
As described in the previous section, the Robovetter makes decisions regarding which TCEs are FPs and PCs based on a collection of metrics and thresholds.  For each metric we apply a threshold and if the TCE's metric's value lies above (or below, depending on the metric) the TCE is called a false positive.  Ideally the Robovetter metric thresholds would be tuned so that no true planet candidates are lost and all of the known false positives are removed; however, this is not a realistic goal.  Instead we sacrifice a few \injtce{s} in order to improve our measured reliability. 

We used automated methods, which we describe below, to search for those thresholds that achieved the highest completeness and effectiveness measured using the simulated data sets (\S\ref{s:relcalc}). We found that because of the period and MES dependence of the various metrics, the prevalence of different types of false alarms in different parts of parameter space, and because the simulated TCE sets did not perfectly emulate the data sets (e.g. the injections were heavily weighted towards long periods and low MES), we only used the thresholds found from this automated optimization to inform how we chose the final set of thresholds.


%No metric is perfect. The metrics we use in the Robovetter are those that were identified to remove a significant number of FPs while only throwing away a small number of PCs.  However, some metrics work on small populations 
%As a result the set of potential thresholds to use is infinite and there is no perfect way to tune the Robovetter.
%We tuned the Robovetter by measuring the reliability and completeness measured from these simulated data sets. 

\subsection{Setting Metric Thresholds Through Optimization}
\label{s:full_optimize}
For the first step in Robovetter tuning, we perform an optimization that finds the metric thresholds that maximize the number TCEs from the \injtce\ set classified as PCs, called {\it true positives}, and minimizes the number of TCEs from the \scrtce\ and \invtce\ sets identified as PCs, called {\it false positives}.  We define the {\it true positive fraction} (TPF) as the ratio of the number of \injtce\ TCEs classified as PC to the total number of \injtce\ TCEs (this is a measure of the catalog completeness, $C$), and the {\it false positive fraction} (FPF) as the number of TCEs from the \scrtce\ and \invtce\ sets identified as PCs to the total number of \scrtce\ and \invtce\ TCEs (this is a measure of ineffectiveness or one minus the effectiveness $1-E$).  Optimization varies the thresholds of the subset of Robovetter metrics described below, looking for those thresholds that maximize completeness and minimize ineffectiveness.

This optimization is performed jointly across a subset of the metrics described in \S\ref{s:robovetter}.  Metrics chosen for this joint optimization are either believed {\it a priori} to distinguish true positives from false positives or have distributions in the \injtce\ set are statistically well-separated from those in the \scrtce\ and \invtce\ sets.  By ``well-separated" we mean that the distributions' medians are separated by more than 0.5 times the largest maximum absolute deviation of the \injtce, \scrtce\ or \invtce\ sets.  The set of metrics chosen for the joint optimization, called ``optimized metrics" are: LPP for the DV and ALT detrending (\S\ref{s:lpp}), the model shift uniqueness test metrics $MS_{1}$, $MS_{2}$, and $MS_{3}$ for the DV and ALT detrending (\S\ref{s:ms}), ${{\rm SES}_{\rm Max} / {\rm MES}}$ (\S\ref{s:sesmes}), and per TCE Chases (\S\ref{s:tcechases}). 

Metrics not used in the joint optimization are incorporated by classifying TCEs as PCs or FPs using {\it a priori} thresholds for these non-optimized metrics prior to optimization of the optimized metrics.  After optimization, a TCE is classified as a PC only if it passes both the non-optimized metrics and the optimized metrics.  Prior to optimization the thresholds for these non-optimized metrics passed about 80\% of the  \injtce\ set, so the final optimized set can have at most 80\% completeness.  

Optimization is performed by varying the optimized thresholds, determining which TCEs are classified as PCs by both the optimized and non-optimized metrics using the new optimized thresholds, and computing the TPF and FPF.  Our optimization seeks thresholds that minimize the objective function $\sqrt{{\rm FPF}^2 + ({\rm TPF} - {\rm TPF}_0)^2}$, where ${\rm TPF}_0$ is the target true positive fraction, so the optimization tries to get as close as possible to ${\rm FPF} = 0$ and ${\rm TPF} = {\rm TPF}_0$.  We varied ${\rm TPF}_0$ in an effort to minimize the false positive fraction. The thresholds are varied from random starting seed values, using the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm via the \textsc{MATLAB} {\it fminsearch} function.  This \textsc{MATLAB} function varies the thresholds until the objective function is minimized.  There are many local minima, so the optimal thresholds depend sensitively on the random starting threshold values.  The optimal thresholds we use provide the smallest of 2000 optimizations with different random seed values.

Our final optimal threshold used ${\rm TPF}_0 = 0.8$, which resulted in thresholds that gave ${\rm FPF} = 0.0044$ and ${\rm TPF} = 0.799$.  We experimented with smaller values of ${\rm TPF}_0$, but these did not significantly lower FPF.   We also performed an optimization that maximized reliability defined in \S\ref{s:relcalc} rather than minimizes FPF, with similar results.  

We explored using only one of \scrtce\ or \invtce\ to determine the FPF, and found that using both provided the best starting point for the final Robovetter thresholds described below.  We also explored the dependence of the optimal thresholds on the range of TCE MES and period.  We found that the thresholds have a moderate dependence, while the FPF and TPF have significant dependence on MES and period range.  For example, optimizing to the low-MES, long-period regime of long-period small-planet TCEs,  we find ${\rm FPF} = 0.028$ and ${\rm TPF} = 0.73$.  Exploration of this dependence of Robovetter threshold on MES and period range is a topic of future study.

\subsection{Picking the Final Robovetter Metric Thresholds}

The results of this algorithmic optimization was used as a starting point for the final thresholds chosen for the DR25 catalog. We used the Confirmed Planet table and the Certified False Positive Table at NExScI, as well as the results of some prominent KOIs,  to adjust the thresholds.  Because most of the \injtce{s}, \invtce{s} and \scrtce{s} are at long periods and low MES the automated tuning optimized the completeness and effectiveness for this part of the catalog. However, many of \Kepler{'s} planet candidates are short period and high SNR. The final catalog thresholds balanced the needs of the different parts of the catalog and endeavoured to keep the completeness of the long period candidates above 70 per cent.

For those interested in a certain part of the KOI catalog, it may be better to re-tune to optimize for higher reliability or to more aggressively remove certain types of false alarms.   The Robovetter code \footnote{\url{https://github.com/nasa/kepler-robovetter}} (and the Robovetter input files) are provided with the tunable thresholds listed at the top of the code.  As an example, we include Table~\ref{t:thresholds} as a list of the easily tunable thresholds for the metrics that determine whether an object is not transit-like.  The table lists the thresholds we settled on for the DR25 catalog we present here, but it also provides the metrics for a higher reliability (lower completeness) catalog and a higher completeness (lower reliability) catalog. Each metric has its own range of possible values and some are more sensitive to small adjustments than others.  Users should use caution when changing the thresholds and should endeavour to understand the different metrics in \S\ref{s:robovetter} before doing so.
